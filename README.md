## Description

This is a simple template for users to create a receipt (invoice) for themselves. Users can add items such as laptops, enter their prices and quantities, and the app will automatically calculate the total amount. Additionally, users can remove items as needed and take a screenshot of their receipt to share with others.

This project was developed using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** as a practice project, showcasing my skills in front-end development.

## Features

- Add items with name, price, and quantity.
- Automatically calculate the total amount.
- Remove items from the invoice.
- Error handling for user inputs.
